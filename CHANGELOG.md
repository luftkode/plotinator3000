# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

## [1.0.1]

### Changed

- Added a notification whenever a log is loaded, showing the total data points of loaded files.

### Internal

- Cleanup unused library code
- Prepare support for a new version of the mbed config present in mbed log headers.

## [1.0.0]

### Changed

- `logviewer-rs` is now renamed to `Plotinator3000`, signifying that it is not really a logviewer and more of a plotting app that will plot any supported format, and do it very fast.

## [0.28.0]

### Added

- Auto updater that queries for newer versions and opens an installer window if a new update is available

## [0.27.0]

### Added

- Support for the `NavSys.sps` format.

## [0.26.0]

### Fix

- Plot alignment

### Changed

- Make some UI elements smaller
- Allow main window (viewport) to be shrink much more than before
- Plot setting UI elements wrap instead of stay fixed when window shrinks

## [0.25.0]

### Added

- File dialog for native and web, which also allows mobile users to load logs.

### Changed

- Various UI tweaks
- Clean up some outdated error messages.

### Internals

- Decouple file parsing from file loading method.

## [0.24.1]

### Fix

- Web version of `plotinator3000` was broken due an integer overflow. When determining down sample level, a cast from 64-bit float to pointer size caused integer overflow on wasm due to wasm having a 32-bit pointer size.

## [0.24.0]

### Added

- Initial support for `HDF` files, starting with bifrost (TX) loop current. The feature is currently guarded behind a feature flag, enabling it is tracked at: https://github.com/luftkode/plotinator3000/issues/84.

### Changed

- Various UI tweaks

### Internal

- Upgraded `cargo-dist` `0.22.1` -> `0.23.0`

## [0.23.0]

### Added

- A warning notification is now shown if a log was parsed from contents where more than 128 bytes of the content was not recognized as log content (and therefor skipped)
- When viewing log info, the first line shows parse info, how many bytes were parsed out of the total length of the file.

### Changed

- Plot labels are now sorted alphabetically
- Remove unused `T_SHUTDOWN` config value that was not supposed to be in mbed log v2.
- Avoid downsampling all the way to 2 samples by setting a minimum downsample threshold (set to 512 samples)
- Avoid storing redundant copies of source plot data when creating multiple mipmaps from the same source.

### Internals

- Refactor to simplify mipmap configuration

## [0.22.0]

### Changed

- Plots retain the color they originally were assigned, no matter if logs are toggled to be invisible or a plot filter is hiding some plots.
- Min/max downsampled plots now have the same color

### Internals

- Refactor to reduce a bunch of duplication and tech debt

## [0.21.0]

### Changed

- Much faster way of determining which plot points that fit within plot boundings.
- Avoid double work when auto downsampling is enabled, previously the fitting downsampling level was first found before handing off that level to a filtering function, which would find partition bounds that were already known from finding the fitting downsampling level.

## [0.20.0]

### Added

- Display log metadata when clicking on a loaded log.

### Fix

- `Mbed status Log v2` mistakenly interpreted as `Mbed status Log v1` when loaded via a path (native `plotinator3000`)

## [0.19.0]

### Added

- Support for Mbed Log version 2

## [0.18.4]

### Changed

- Remove playback feature

## [0.18.3]

### Fix

- Integer overflow when searching for the appropriate downsampled MipMap level.

## [0.18.2]

### Changed

- Much faster implementation for finding the appropriate MipMap level for the current zoom level.

### Fix

- Min/Max MipMap algorithm flipped min and max.

## [0.18.1]

### Fix

- Fix accidentally using plot **name** instead of plot **label**, causing name conflicts when plotting multiple plots with the same name
- Bad naming in a PID controller implementation caused misunderstanding, what we thought was the PID error was actually the PID output.

## [0.18.0]

### Added

- Min/Max MipMap downsampling which makes plotting much larger datasets feasible, and facilitates outlier detection.

### Internals

- Major clearing of tech debts related to plot settings and the ui for plot settings.

## [0.17.0]

### Added

- Allow toggling whether or not plots from each loaded log are shown.

### Internals

- Update dependencies

## [0.16.0]

### Added

- Hovering on a plot now also shows the plot name.
- Allow Filtering the shown plots by legend/label name.

### Changed

- (Native only) Recursively parsing drag-n-dropped directories also parses zip archives
- Reduce UI by allowing toggling the list of logs.
- Reduce UI cluttering by removing the "Time" label on the X-axis.
- Reduce verbosity of the name of logs
- Better visuals for viewing and changing settings of loaded logs

### Internals

- Refactors

## [0.15.0]

### Added

- (Not available on web version) Recursively parse drag-n-dropped directories for supported logs
- (Not available on web version) Recursively parse drag-n-dropped zip archives for supported logs
- Show tooltip when hovering above a clickable log name

### Internals

- Refactors

## [0.14.0]

### Add

- Ability for logs to add labels (rough initial mvp, needs more work)
- `show grid` button for showing/hiding grid lines on plots

## [0.13.0]

### Internals

- Better divide interfaces in the `log_if` crate and use a prelude to make it easy to import all relevant traits via glob imports.
- Change `GitMetadata` trait to return `Option<String>` to accommodate logs that don't contain git metadata.

### Changes

- Mbed motor control PID log's `RPM Error Count` and `First Valid RPM Count` are moved to the plot ranging from 1-100.

## [0.12.0]

### Changes

- Allow Setting the date/offset of plots with the `Enter`-key and closing the settings window by pressing `Escape`
- Upgrade `egui` to v0.29
- Y-axis lock is now compatible with all zoom and scroll actions

### Internals

- Migrate to workspace project structure
- Decouple Log implementation from the plotting interface
